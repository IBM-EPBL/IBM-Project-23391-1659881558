# ABSTRACT:
During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority and the donor count has become low. Saving the donor information and helping the needy by
notifying the current donors list, would be a helping hand. In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would take the donor details,store
them and inform them upon a request.
